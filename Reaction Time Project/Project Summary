Research Question: What is the diurnal pattern of reaction time? 
Subjects: 40 students from STA490 class
Methods: Linear Mixed Model
Procedure: Data Cleaning -> EDA -> Assumption Check -> Modelling -> Find the best suitable model -> Draw conclusions.

Conclusions:
The result of our study reveals that students from STA490 class tend to have lower reaction time right before sleep and 
six hours before sleep comparing to waking up time. And one unit increasing in hungry level six hours after waking up will 
decrease your overall reaction time much more than one unit increasing in hungry level at waking up time for students from 
STA490 class. However, one unit increasing in hungry level 12 hours after waking up will decrease your overall reaction time 
much less than the one unit increasing in hungry level at waking up time for students from STA490 class.
